App is currently totally broken, I want to refactor + update current BE (django) 

and add frontend framework running on React.



Current state -> connected FE with BE, getting requests but no visual GUI,

all different pieces of code randomly put together without working yet



toDo:

BACKEND
1. Refactor urls, api, serializers
2. Check out with postman and clean up the code
3. Migrate all, set it ready for FE

FRONTEND
1. Use templates from BE and start react
2. Make home page + basic Layout
3. Add more basic components, might even use bootstrap or some libraries
4. Display + add some data from/to BE
5. Add authentication
6. Add redux to it
